### Project Tittle: Using SQL Server Environment to Analyze LITA Capstone Dataset

### Project Overview
This project involved analyzing sales and customer data for a retail store to assess performance and customer trends. Using MySQL, I evaluated total sales, product popularity, regional contributions, and monthly sales trends. Key findings included identifying the highest-selling products, top-spending customers, and regions contributing the most to overall sales. Additionally, I assessed customer subscription data to understand revenue by subscription type and the status of active subscriptions. The analysis provided insights into seasonal demand, customer loyalty, and product performance, enabling data-driven recommendations for maximizing revenue, optimizing inventory, and enhancing customer retention strategies for the retail store.
