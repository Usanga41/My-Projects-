### Project Tittle: Using SQL Server Environment to Analyze LITA Capstone Dataset

### Project Overview
This project involved analyzing sales and customer data for a retail store to assess performance and customer trends. Using MySQL, I evaluated total sales, product popularity, regional contributions, and monthly sales trends. Key findings included identifying the highest-selling products, top-spending customers, and regions contributing the most to overall sales. Additionally, I assessed customer subscription data to understand revenue by subscription type and the status of active subscriptions. The analysis provided insights into seasonal demand, customer loyalty, and product performance, enabling data-driven recommendations for maximizing revenue, optimizing inventory, and enhancing customer retention strategies for the retail store.

### Data Decsription 
The dataset comprised two tables: Orders and Customers. The Orders table included details such as OrderID, CustomerID, Product, Region, OrderDate, Quantity, and UnitPrice, providing information on sales transactions, product categories, and regional performance. Key metrics such as total sales, transaction count, and monthly revenue were derived from this data. The Customers table contained CustomerID, CustomerName, Region, SubscriptionType, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd, Canceled, and Revenue fields, giving insights into customer demographics, subscription status, and revenue per customer. Together, these datasets facilitated a comprehensive analysis of product performance, customer trends, and regional sales contributions for the retail store.
